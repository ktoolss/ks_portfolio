                        <h1>Geology to Javascript</h1>

                        <p>Hi. Thanks for taking some time to learn about me. My name is Kristian and I grew up in Houston, TX. I went to the University of Houston for a B.S. of Geology, with two minors of Geophysics and Biology. I was employed as a geoscientist for 5 years, until I used C# to develop a <a href="https://github.com/ktoolss/Mama/blob/master/soilCalculator.cs">Soils Lab Calculator</a> to automate calculations in the lab I was working in. I discovered how much I really enjoyed coding and decided to enroll in a Bootcamp to enhance my skills.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
                        <p>I'm currently working as a frontend software engineer at Eagle Eye Networks. EEN focuses on cloud video surveillance. I work in an agile environment with many experienced colleagues. We work together to resolve bugs and develop quality software.</p>

                        <!-- <h1>Currently Learning</h1>

                        <p>I am currently learning Docker, Python, Angular.</p> -->

                    <h1>ACC Software Bootcamp</h1>

                    <p>Software Developer Bootcamp Fall 2021</p>
                    
                    <h1>Bootcamp Group Project</h1>
                    <p>We were offered an oppurtunity to develop an application, and pitch this idea to the rest of the class for it to be selected as one of five group projects.</p>

                    <p>My project was chosen and I became the project leader for a Javascript <a href="https://github.com/ktoolss/myProjects/tree/master/portfolioProJects/blochainProjects/theCoin">Blockchain Project</a>. The blockchain is using a client, server, blockchain algorithm source code, and MongoDB/Mongoose for the database. The team is utilizing an agile workflow with two weekly meetings, where we rotate project manager duties.</p>

                    <p>As the lead developer, I researched the blockchain algorithms and npm modules, as well as connected the database and client. After this, I made a pitch to the class for my project to be accepted as one of the final projects.</p>

                    <!-- <h1>Current Bootcamp Coursework</h1>

                    <p>I am currently learning both class based and function based React applications. One of the main questions I ask myself while programming is "How is the data flowing?" I've found the components in React help make the plumbing of the app very transparent, and I'm excited to learn more about the effieciency of component based libraries.</p> -->
